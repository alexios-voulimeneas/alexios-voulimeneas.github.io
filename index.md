## [](#header-2)News

**March 2025:** Our paper "Divide and Conquer: Introducing Partial Multi-Variant Execution" got accepted at Euro S&P 2025. Congrats Jonas, Adriaan, and Stijn.   

**February 2025:** Tenure, finally—through blisters and bedrock!

This would never have been possible without the unwavering support of so many people, both professionally and personally. Grateful beyond words for the mentors, colleagues, friends, and family who guided, encouraged, and believed in me through every challenge and milestone!

**December 2024:** We won one of the two awarded Best Paper Awards at ACSAC 2024 (out of a total of 83 accepted papers / 424 total papers submitted to the conference / 381 strictly reviewed papers after desk rejects).

Congratulations and thanks to my co-authors André, Stijn, and Michael!

## [](#header-2)Bio

I am a tenured Assistant Professor in the [Cybersecurity](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/intelligent-systems/cybersecurityeemcs/people) research group at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). I am also part of TU Delft's Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.

From September 2020 until August 2023, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group at [KU Leuven's Technology Campus](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/english/ghent/ghent) in Ghent, Belgium.

I obtained my PhD degree from [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in 2020 under the supervision of Professor [Michael Franz](http://www.michaelfranz.com/).
In my [PhD dissertation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2719443b), I proposed new techniques to improve the security and performance of N-Variant eXecution (NVX) systems. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Athens University of Economics and Business/Department of Informatics, Greece](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs). I have also done internships at Oracle Labs and Apple. You can contact me at A.Voulimeneas AT tudelft DOT nl or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/systemsgreek).

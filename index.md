**Looking for motivated PhD students to work on Systems and Security related research topics. You can contact me at A.Voulimeneas AT tudelft DOT nl!!!**

## [](#header-2)Bio

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Cybersecurity](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/intelligent-systems/cybersecurityeemcs/people) research group at TU Delft.

From September 2020 until August 2023, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [imec-DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group at [KU Leuven's Technology Campus](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/english/ghent/ghent) in Ghent, Belgium.

I obtained my PhD degree from [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in 2020 under the supervision of Professor [Michael Franz](http://www.michaelfranz.com/).
In my [PhD dissertation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2719443b), I proposed new techniques to improve the security and performance of N-Variant eXecution (NVX) systems. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Athens University of Economics and Business/Department of Informatics, Greece](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs). I have also done internships at Oracle Labs and Apple. You can contact me at A.Voulimeneas AT tudelft DOT nl or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/systemsgreek).
